# Odin-recipes
<!--Hey hope whoever is looking at this is having a great day. My current project is going to be a website dedicated to finding recipes. By the end of this project I will have demonstrated sufficient use of my terminal by making use of "git" and the command prompts that come with. I will have created my "hmtl" doctype from scratch without using any shortcuts.>
